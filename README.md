Here’s a template for a README file for your “virus” project. It’s important to note that creating or distributing malicious software without clear and ethical purposes is illegal and harmful. If your project is purely for educational or ethical hacking purposes, you may want to emphasize that in the README and clearly state its intended use.

Random Click Virus

Description

The Random Click Virus is a Python-based script that simulates random mouse clicks on the screen. The program runs in the background, periodically clicking at random positions within the active screen or application. This project is intended purely for educational and research purposes to demonstrate basic concepts of automation and interaction with user interfaces through Python.

Disclaimer

This script should not be used for any malicious purposes. Running this code on your machine could cause unintended consequences, such as disrupting workflows or triggering unwanted behaviors. Use this project solely for educational purposes, and only with the consent of users who are aware of the script’s actions. By using this code, you agree to take full responsibility for its effects.

Features

	•	Randomly simulates mouse clicks at random screen coordinates.
	•	Allows for continuous or time-limited execution.
	•	Useful for learning automation concepts, such as handling mouse events.

Prerequisites

Before using this script, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

	•	pyautogui - To automate the mouse movement and click actions.

You can install the required dependencies with pip:

pip install pyautogui

Usage

	1.	Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/1Godzilla/virus-building.git


	2.	Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
	3.	Run the script using Python:

python random_click_virus.py


	4.	The script will begin executing and simulate random mouse clicks.

How It Works

The script uses the pyautogui library to simulate mouse clicks. It randomly selects a point on the screen and clicks on it. The clicks can be triggered at random intervals, making the movements appear erratic.

Example

import pyautogui
import random
import time

# Set the screen width and height (you can adjust this based on your screen resolution)
screen_width, screen_height = pyautogui.size()

# Set how long the script should run (in seconds)
run_time = 60  # Runs for 60 seconds
end_time = time.time() + run_time

while time.time() < end_time:
    # Generate random screen coordinates
    x = random.randint(0, screen_width)
    y = random.randint(0, screen_height)
    
    # Move the mouse to the random location and click
    pyautogui.click(x, y)
    
    # Wait for a random amount of time before clicking again
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 2))

This script will randomly click around the screen for a specified duration (in this example, 60 seconds).

Important Notes

	•	Be cautious: Running this script without supervision can make it difficult to control your computer. Be sure to test in a controlled environment where you can safely stop the script.
	•	Security: This script should not be used on any unauthorized machines or environments.
